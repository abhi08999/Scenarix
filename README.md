## Overview
The MagicMoments project is a Next.js (TypeScript) landing website with multiple pages (landing, demo, blog, gallery, pricing). The following changes were made to optimize performance, fix bugs, and improve code quality.

## Optimizations and Fixes (Where/What/Why) format

1.	app/layout.tsx

Where: app/layout.tsx
What:
‚Ä¢	Removed all <link> Google Fonts and replaced them with Next.js font optimization using next/font/google.
‚Ä¢	Reduced Font Payload: Only imported fonts that are referenced in UI components.
‚Ä¢	Applied font variables to the <html> tag for global font access.

‚Ä¢	Removed Unnecessary ESLint Disable: Removed /* eslint-disable @next/next/no-page-custom-font */ as it's no longer needed
               Why:
‚Ä¢	Loading dozens of fonts via <link> severely degrades performance (FCP, CLS, TTFB).
‚Ä¢	Using CSS variables ensures each font is available for use in components.


2.	app/components/Gallery.tsx

Where : app/components/Gallery.tsx
What :

‚Ä¢	Image Optimization: Replaced <img> with Next.js <Image> for all gallery images.
‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Added descriptive alt attributes to images.
‚Ä¢	Responsive Images: Used the sizes prop for better responsive loading.

   Why:

‚Ä¢	<Image> provides lazy loading, automatic resizing, and WebP support, reducing bandwidth and improving LCP.
‚Ä¢	Alt text improves accessibility and SEO.
‚Ä¢	Responsive images ensure the right size is delivered to each device.
      
3.	 app/components/Hero.tsx

 Where : app/components/Hero.tsx
 What:  
‚Ä¢	Video Optimization: Added a poster attribute to the background <video> for faster first paint.
‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Added aria-hidden="true" to the decorative video.
‚Ä¢	Preload: Added  preload="none"
‚Ä¢	Bug Fix : Replace video src with actual path available  in public folder /7670835-uhd_3840_2160_30fps.mp4


Why:
‚Ä¢	poster ensures a fallback image is shown while the video loads, improving perceived performance.
‚Ä¢	aria-hidden prevents screen readers from reading decorative content.
‚Ä¢	Add preload=‚Äùnone‚Äù to prevent early laoding

4.	app/components/FontShowcase.tsx

  Where : app/components/FontShowcase.tsx
  What:  
‚Ä¢	Uses Next.js font variables for correct font family and weight .
Migrated from Google Fonts CDN to Next.js next/font system
              Why:
‚Ä¢	Ensures each font is loaded and rendered with the correct weight and style.
‚Ä¢	Eliminates render-blocking external font requests
‚Ä¢	Enables automatic font optimization with display: swap
‚Ä¢	Reduces CLS by ensuring font loading is handled efficiently



 5. app/gallery/page.tsx

     Where: app/gallery/page.tsx


     What:
‚Ä¢	Infinite Scroll: Loads more images as you scroll, using Intersection Observer.

‚Ä¢	Image Optimization: Uses Next.js <Image> for all gallery images.
‚Ä¢	Removed API Key Logging: For security.
         Why:
‚Ä¢	Infinite scroll improves performance and UX with large datasets// or also we can use pagination as alternative.
‚Ä¢	<Image> optimizes images (lazy loading, responsive, WebP).
‚Ä¢	No sensitive info is logged.

6.app/blog/page.tsx
 Where: app/blog/page.tsx
 What:
‚Ä¢	Add Proper Loading skeletons with dynamic import
‚Ä¢	Replace img with next/image <Image>
         Why:
‚Ä¢	Faster initial load
‚Ä¢	  Reduce layout shift
‚Ä¢	<Image> provides lazy loading, automatic resizing, and WebP support, reducing bandwidth and improving LCP.
